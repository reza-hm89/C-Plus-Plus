HSV to RGB
 

RGB

     The most famous color encoding is an aditive system with 3 components, Red, Green and Blue.  Computer monitors emit color as RGB.

 

 

HSV

     A system which represents color as Hue, Saturation and Value.  Hue is what is seen as the color.  Saturation is how “pure” the color is.  0% is grey and 100% is a pure color.  Value represents the brightness.  The conversion from RGB is simple.  V is the biggest value of R,G and B ( max(r,g,b)). V = 100% is white and 0% is black.  If V is different then 0, we have a chromatic color.  Saturation is defined as a ratio of V and a delta of the minimum and maximum values.  The Hue depends on V, and is obtained with simple math for each case.

 

RGB values from 0 to 1

 

Implementation:

 

void HSVtoRGB(double h, double s, double v, double* r, double* g, double* b)

{

  if ( s == 0 ) 

  {

     *r = v;

     *g = v;

     *b = v;

  }

  else

  {

     double var_h = h * 6;

     double var_i = floor( var_h );

     double var_1 = v * ( 1 - s );

     double var_2 = v * ( 1 - s * ( var_h - var_i ) );

     double var_3 = v * ( 1 - s * ( 1 - ( var_h - var_i ) ) );

 

     if      ( var_i == 0 ) { *r = v     ; *g = var_3 ; *b = var_1; }

     else if ( var_i == 1 ) { *r = var_2 ; *g = v     ; *b = var_1; }

     else if ( var_i == 2 ) { *r = var_1 ; *g = v     ; *b = var_3; }

     else if ( var_i == 3 ) { *r = var_1 ; *g = var_2 ; *b = v;     }

     else if ( var_i == 4 ) { *r = var_3 ; *g = var_1 ; *b = v;     }

     else                   { *r = v     ; *g = var_1 ; *b = var_2; }

 

  }

}

HSV values = From 0 to 1
